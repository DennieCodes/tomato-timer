The tomato-timer is a project that I created based upon the Pomodoro technique which can be useful for helping someone keep their efforts on track and focused.  The concept is for a timer of 25 minutes to be set for whatever productive activity is pursued, and at its conclusion a 5 minute break is taken.  After four of these cycles are completed then the person would take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

This project is created using React.
